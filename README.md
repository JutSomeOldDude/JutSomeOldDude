- 👋 Hi, I’m @JutSomeOldDude
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to use github and becoming a late to the party web developr. Tall order for a 40+ 3 time loser with more motivtion than sense!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything I can about todays tech and especially Ai. Its amazing as heck and it's a wonderful time to be alive.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything someone may ask me to do or try to do. I'll gladly give it a go if asked, but I'm of no ilk to jump in and write code for anything more than maybe a light bash script or some very basic python.
- 📫 But if you're a little dim or desperate its 254-300-1710, sms only please, or shoot the mail to sull3n@outlook.com and I will catch ya asap.
- 😄 Pronouns: Me, Mine, He, Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can make a bigger mess with a fresh distro and pacman, bigger than anyone can clean up!
